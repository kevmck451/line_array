    Order 1-2: Gentle roll-off. Suitable for applications where a gradual transition is acceptable.
    Order 3-4: Moderate roll-off. Offers a balance between roll-off steepness and computational complexity.
    Order 5-6: Steeper roll-off. Provides better separation between the passband and stopband frequencies.
    Order 7-10: Very steep roll-off. Useful for applications requiring precise frequency separation, but can be more computationally intensive and may introduce more phase distortion.
