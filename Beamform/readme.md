# Mic Array / FIR Filter

1. Convolution


2. Summation


3. Normalization

   
## Convolution:
 * Convolve each microphone's input signal with its corresponding FIR filter coefficients.
 * Convolution is a process where the input signal is multiplied and summed with the FIR filter coefficients to produce a delayed output signal.

## Summation:
 * Sum the delayed signals from all microphones.
 * This summation aligns the signals from the desired direction (beamforming), enhancing them while attenuating signals from other directions.

## Normalization:
 * Bring values back into expected ranges
